    <h1>Yo for anything.</h1>
    <hr>
        <h5>
            In the past the Yo app was used to passively receive Yo's from
            subscriptions, or to Yo friends. We just changed that. 
        </h5>
        <h2>
            Introducing YOMOTE, the app that lets you Yo for anything. 
        </h2>
        <h4>
            All of the Usernames on YOMOTE are like buttons on your personal
            remote control for life. Simply search through the created
            usernames and when you find one you like, add it to your Yo
            contacts.
        </h4>
    <h5>
        For Developers:
        <br><br>
        We make the process of creating Yo apps fast and easy. Write a few
        lines of code (on top of our available <a href="/docs" class="ymlink">
        pre-defined library</a>) and tell us what information you need to know
        from your users to make the app work. We then provide you a callback
        endpoint on our server. Simple.
        This saves you the time of writing an entire webapp just to use the Yo
        API, the cost of hosting the app on your own servers, and the hassle of
        associating information with individual users. All of this is taken
        care of by us, so you can focus on creating.
        <br><br>
        For Yo Users: Welcome to the future. Our site provides the top YOMOTE
        services as ranked by the number of Yo's they have received.
